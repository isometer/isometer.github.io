              <p>
                Working under Drs. <a href="https://www.smu.edu/lyle/departments/ece/people/faculty/zoghi-ben">Ben Zoghi</a> and <a href="https://engineering.tamu.edu/cse/profiles/tahammond.html">Tracy Hammond</a>, I was challenged to create a Natural Language Processing (NLP) system that could identify consistent emotional triggers for individuals given a set of short journal entries describing discrete emotional experiences. 
                I developed a model and architecture capable of doing just this â€” and it's impressively accurate! 
                The technology has a long way to go before I would consider it polished, but this presents a fascinating development in cognitive NLP.
              </p>
              <p>
                I'm currently working on writing a conference paper reporting on this research, and the full 96-page thesis will eventually be published in Texas A&M's OakTrust repository.

                Please feel free to <a href="../index.html#contact">reach out</a> if you have questions about this project! There's a lot more nuance involved than I can address in this blurb.
