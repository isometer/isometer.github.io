# Brigham's Portfolio

### A minimalistic portfolio for showcasing my work as a developer.

This portfolio was built based on [this template by nisarhassan12](https://github.com/nisarhassan12/portfolio-template/tree/master) -- you can find its readme [here](https://github.com/nisarhassan12/portfolio-template/blob/master/README.md) for more information about the template itself.

This site is hosted identically on [my GitHub Pages](isometer.github.io) as well as my [personal domain](brigham-pettit.com).
